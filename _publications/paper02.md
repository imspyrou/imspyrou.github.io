Droughts have become more frequent and more intense in countries across the world. In this study, we assess the impact of droughts on children’s well-being. We combine a rich panel data set on 2000 school-aged children with monthly rainfall data in Ethiopia between 2009 and 2017. We find that droughts decrease the probability that a child will remain enrolled in school by more than 36%. Among children who remain enrolled, droughts adversely affect their grade progression. These children suffered from high food insecurity. Girls, in particular, were at a greater risk of being malnourished and stunted. With the onset of a drought, children spent more time on paid activities and less time on sleep. Overall droughts had a significant negative impact on children’s overall well-being.
