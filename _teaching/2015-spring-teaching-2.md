This course provides an overview of the principles of economic analysis and focuses on how individuals, households, businesses, and industries make choices and interact with one another regarding the allocation and utilization of limited resources while creating a complex, dynamic, adaptive system. Students apply economics concepts to analyze phenomena in everyday life, analyze decision making processes in microeconomics, and apply an ‘economics lens’ to observations of events and choices in the world and better understand these actions and choices.
