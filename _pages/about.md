I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [School of Economics at the Georgia Institute of Technology](https://econ.gatech.edu/). I received my MA in Statistics and Applied Mathematics from the City University of New York in 2017. My graduate studies include an MA in Environmental and Plant Pathology Sciences.

I am an applied microeconomist and data analyst working on issues at the intersection of development and agricultural economics. My research focuses on the impact of natural disasters on well-being and on alleviation strategies including sustainable agricultural practices. My research spans food insecurity drivers, while applying machine learning techniques to predict food security. 

Other than economics, I enjoy jogging, painting, and swimming.
